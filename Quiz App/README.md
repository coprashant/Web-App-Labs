# Title  
**Mathematical Quiz Game Using React and Django**

---

## Objectives  
- To learn the fundamentals of React and component-based UI development  
- To understand frontend–backend communication using REST APIs
- To integrate a React frontend with a Django backend  
- To build an interactive mathematical quiz application  

---

## Project Description  
This project is a **fun mathematical quiz game** developed using **React** for the frontend and **Django** for the backend. The application generates simple arithmetic questions and evaluates user input in real time while maintaining a score. Additionally, data is fetched from the Django backend and displayed in the React interface to demonstrate API communication.

The project was developed primarily as a learning exercise to understand React basics such as state management, hooks, and event handling, along with Django’s JSON-based API responses.

## Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Frontend:** React (JavaScript)  
- **Backend:** Django (Python)  
- **API Format:** JSON  
- **Database:** SQLite

## Discussion  
This project provided practical exposure to React concepts including state management using `useState`, lifecycle handling with `useEffect`, and user interaction through events. The quiz logic helped reinforce real-time UI updates based on user input. On the backend side, Django was used to serve data in JSON format, allowing React to fetch and display information dynamically. The integration of both technologies helped in understanding how modern web applications separate frontend and backend responsibilities.

---

## Conclusion  
The Mathematical Quiz Game successfully demonstrates the basic integration of a React frontend with a Django backend. It meets its learning objectives by implementing interactive UI logic and API-based data exchange. This project serves as a strong foundation for advancing toward more complex full-stack applications using modern web technologies.
